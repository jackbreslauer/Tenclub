# Project: Tenclub

## About Me
- Product manager building my first iOS app
- Limited technical experience

## Goals
1. Build the app
2. Learn software development process
3. Learn (through doing) how to best collaborate with tools such as Claude Code

## How to Help Me
- Explain concepts in plain language
- Walk through steps clearly
- Answer "tangential" questions - I'm here to learn
- Tell me when something is optional/nice-to-know vs critical
- Proactively handle git commits - don't wait for me to ask
- Raise important architectural or technical decisions as we build

## Development Philosophy
Start with an MVP proof-of-concept. Build sequentially through versions (V1 → V2 → V3 → V4), validating at each point. Use scalable infrastructure and coding practices where possible without overbuilding.

## The App
A screen time management app based on the philosophy that **screen unlocks** (not total screen time) is the critical variable to manage. Unlocks represent disruption and distraction from life.

## Tech Stack
- iOS (SwiftUI)
- Screen Time API (DeviceActivity framework)
- SMS service for accountability buddy notifications (V3)

## Version Roadmap
- **V1:** Simple app showing daily unlock count
- **V2:** Home screen widget
- **V3:** Accountability buddy with SMS notifications
- **V4:** User accounts and centralized data storage
